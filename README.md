Placeholder for a database for spectral geometry, that the "geometry" of a Riemannian manifold (with boundary) is determined by the **spectrum**

* of eigenvalues of the Laplacian, with either Dirichlet or Neurmann (or mixed) boundary condition
* of lengths of geodesics or billiard trajectories

and variations of these, specifically what is known about individual eigenvalues or lengths, or collectively as a set. Inspired / Modeled on the database for L-functions and modular forms.
