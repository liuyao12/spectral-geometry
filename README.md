Placeholder for a database for **spectral geometry**, that the *geometry* of a Riemannian manifold (with boundary) is "determined" by the **spectrum**

* of eigenvalues of the Laplacian, with either Dirichlet or Neumann (or mixed) boundary condition
* of lengths of closed geodesics or billiard trajectories
* or variations thereof

specifically what is known about individual eigenvalues or lengths (rational or algebraic), or collectively as a set. Inspired by and modeled on the databases of integer sequences and of L-functions and modular forms.
